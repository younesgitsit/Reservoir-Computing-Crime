# Reservoir-Computing-Crime

Reservoir Computing is a machine learning model known for its simplicity and efficiency in processing time series data. It utilizes a fixed, dynamic reservoir to project input into a higher-dimensional space, and then train only the read out layer.

This is a report of some of the processes and results I obtained.

Reservoir Computing and Crime Detection. I did this work during my summer 2023 internship at the Department of Homeland Security. The MATLAB files each have a short description of what they do at the top. A good one to check out is "strongestCorrelationSpatial.mat".
